    """Read, reproject, and mosaic multiple bands from a list of STAC items.

    Multi-band variant of :func:`async_mosaic_chunk`.  Processes all requested
    bands together per item so that bands sharing the same source geometry
    compute the reprojection warp map only once (via
    :func:`_apply_bands_with_warp_cache`).

    Items are processed in batches of ``max_concurrent_reads``.  When all
    per-band mosaic methods signal completion, remaining batches are skipped.

    Args:
        items: List of STAC item dicts to mosaic.  Processed in order.
        bands: Asset keys identifying the bands to read from each item.
        chunk_affine: Affine transform of the destination chunk.
        dst_crs: CRS of the destination chunk.
        chunk_width: Width of the destination chunk in pixels.
        chunk_height: Height of the destination chunk in pixels.
        nodata: No-data fill value.
        mosaic_method_cls: Mosaic method class instantiated once per band.
            Defaults to :class:`~lazycogs._mosaic_methods.FirstMethod`.
        store: Optional pre-configured obstore ``ObjectStore`` instance.
        max_concurrent_reads: Maximum number of COG reads to run concurrently.
        warp_cache: Optional cache shared across calls for reusing warp maps
            from earlier time steps.

    Returns:
        ``dict`` mapping each band name to an array of shape
        ``(cog_bands, chunk_height, chunk_width)`` with dtype matching the
        source COGs.
